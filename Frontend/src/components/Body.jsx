        The idea behind this website is to solve the issue of helping students
        overcome the struggles that come with attending a new school. Our team
        wanted to tackle the issue of knowing what classes to take and when to
        take them. Ideally, this website will help students with getting a
        better idea behind their time spent in the Computer Science program at
        MSU Denver. To get this to work, hit the "Generate" button and the
        outcome should be a file that shows you a plan of what classes need to
        be taken.
